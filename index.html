  <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms
    and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information
    systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been
    supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award,
    a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship,
    a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship,
    a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google,
    Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of
    the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering,
    and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

  <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I taught a new course, Choices and
      Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed
      at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a
      range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and
      information.</li>
    <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning
      About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
      <ul>
        <li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
          entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
          introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
          support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are
          supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design. Addison Wesley, 2005.</li>
    <li>An on-line course on edX entitled Networks, Crowds, and Markets,
      with David Easley and Eva Tardos.
      <ul>
        <li>This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that
          we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our
          graduate algorithms course.</li>
      </ul>

    <li>Recent courses at Cornell:
      <ul>
        <li>The Structure of Information Networks (CS 6850)</li>
        <li>Networks (with David Easley and Eva Tardos; ECON 2040 / SOC
          2090 / CS 2850 / INFO 2040).</li>
